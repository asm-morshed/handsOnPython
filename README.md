Here some simple snippets of python as I'm going to start learning Django. The following writting is based on from where I've learnt Python [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python).

During my learning period it seems to me that python is near to C language having some different style of its own. Python code has to write without braces as it uses white spaces to indicate block.

In C when we end a line we use semicolon(;) whereas in python a new line denots end of a line. In some case if it is needed to write two line we have to use backslash(\) which means continuation of the previous line.
